# Valetudo Extras
This is a very much so low effort and unsupported way of pulling in exta options from a robot vacuum running valetudo that are not exposed already over MQTT.

Expect this integration to break, or not work as inteneded as Hypfer says this in Valetudo's quirk UI:
"Please don't try to automate changing quirks as there are no guarantees whatsoever in regards to both stability as well as availability. They just exist for this UI."
I am trying to do just that, purely because I want the ability to toggle room edge mopping in my own vacuum automations.
